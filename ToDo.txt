ISSUE:
  []: Not finding any trains in updates.

AUDIO:
  []: Add audio class to scheduler.

NON-AUDIO:
  []: Fix scheduler refresh function.
  []: Perhaps parse late timings out of scheduler if they do not fall within the next X minutes - depending on the endTime variable.
  []: Add removal of db on app close.
  []: Add "if empty" clause when looking at db - should rerun on a timer equal to that of the endTime variable.
  []: Alpha-based fade drawing.
  []: Multi-drawing functionality.
  []: Test.
  []: Remove logging and clean up.


Fade drawing (canvas): https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41483806/painting-in-canvas-which-fades-with-time-strange-alpha-layering-behaviour
Switch option for live and cached - cached would pertain to a sped-up overview of a single station from the previous day of transport data.

Client -> Call server for coords -> db.grab for location -> ajax return function -> scheduler -> canvas drawing.
If routes departure = undefined, set to be the current station if route is zero.
